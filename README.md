Frame Scan
Frame Scan is a Flutter-based document scanner app that allows users to scan, crop, and save documents efficiently. The app ensures a smooth user experience with state management using GetX and local storage with Hive.



 Features
- Splash Screen & Onboarding: The app starts with a splash screen followed by onboarding screens. If the user clicks "Use Now," their session is saved using Hive, and onboarding will not appear again on subsequent launches.
- User Session Management: The session is stored in local storage using Hive.
- Home Screen: Users can pick an image from the camera or gallery.
- Document Edge Detection & Cropping: The camera scans the document and detects its edges, allowing users to crop and adjust it.
- State Management: GetX is used for efficient and reactive state management.
- MVVM Architecture: The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) structure for better code maintainability.
- Global Utilities: Colors, text styles, and the primary button are stored in a global folder within the `lib/` directory.
- Custom Fonts: The app uses Google Fonts with Poppins for better typography.
- Responsive UI: The app adapts to different screen sizes using `flutter_screenutil`.
